This is a legato vocal implemented in sfz. It's the a vowel from the Hadzi-Fia sample library by Karoryfer Samples. It is intended to help demonstrate some of the things described in the https://sfzformat.com/tutorials/legato/ tutorial.

There are a few patches in the Programs folder with different features described in that tutorial implemented, and hopefully there will be more in the future.
